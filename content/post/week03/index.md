# Developments
<hr>
- The past week has not been particularly remarkable. It was still chilly outside, even though it was almost summer outside. I spent most of my time sitting at home and watching TV shows. 
  
# Cat
- We have finally trimmed our Maine Coon cat. Now he has less wool by 80%. Perhaps this is the most important news. 

# Study
- I also did laboratory work for my studies.
