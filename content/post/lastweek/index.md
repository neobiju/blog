-  During the May holidays, I spent my time very interestingly. I walked a lot with my friends, went to the pool, read and did not sleep until the morning. I also did laboratory work on the subject "Operating systems". 

- I really wanted to go to my parents for the weekend, but unfortunately there were not so many weekends. 
- My last week was fun and interesting.
