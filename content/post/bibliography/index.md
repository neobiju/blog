# Working with bibliography
<hr>
- The Word object model includes several objects designed to automate the creation of bibliographies. The following table lists the main objects of the Word Bibliography feature. 
- Use these objects and additional properties and methods in the Word object model to add sources to source lists, reference sources in a document, and manage sources. 


# Understanding the XML Source
<hr>
- Sources are added to source lists programmatically using XML strings. Depending on the type of source to be added, the XML structure changes. To define the XML structure for a source type, you can manually add the same source type and then view the returned XML.
